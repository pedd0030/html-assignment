        <h2> About me!</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name's Dawson! I was born in Ottawa, ON and have lived here basically my whole life in a small town at the city limits. I went to school in Kanata basically my whole life and now with me starting of college, I live and go to school in Nepean! I am into a <em> ton </em> of different things (which is kinda my issue) but im big into music, clothes, games, some tv, etc. If I could go into something related to my hobbies after college that would be fantastic, but I have a million ideas and things id like to try. During this program If I could devlop some employable skills + use those to create things I love I think I would be a much happier person. During this course at well I would love to meet tons of new people and make lots of new friends. I was basically in solitude for most of covid so my desire to meet new people and make connection.
