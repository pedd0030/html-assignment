        <h2> About me!</h2>
    </article>
            <p> Hello! My name's Dawson! I was born in Ottawa, ON and have lived here basically my whole life in a small town at the city limits. I went to school in Kanata basically my whole life and now with me starting of college, I live and go to school in Nepean! I am into a <em> ton </em> of different things (which is kinda my issue) but im big into music, clothes, games, some tv, etc. If I could go into something related to my hobbies after college that would be fantastic, but I have a million ideas and things id like to try. During this program If I could devlop some employable skills + use those to create things I love I think I would be a much happier person.  
             </p>
    
             <p> Another goal I have while I am in this program is to make tons of new connections. Throughout covid I was very much alone in my life and even now I still feel that way even though I have people in my life. This is probably due to the lack of new/meaningful connections ive made but, throughout this year I hope to develop real meaningful connections with the people ive met and people I will meet. For a while Ive just wanted to meet new people, do new things, etc and college gives me a fantastic opprotunity to try this! </p>

             <p> Life's tough, but its even tougher when your stupid. </p>
